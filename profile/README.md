# Overview of content
### Manuals
- The [**Synthesis dataset manual**](https://github.com/biodiversity-exploratories-synthesis/Synthesis_dataset_manual) helps you to work with the Synthesis datasets. It lists pitfalls and specialities you might consider when working with these datasets.

### Code
- In [**Useful functions**](https://github.com/biodiversity-exploratories-synthesis/Synthesis_useful_functions) you find a collection of functions we often use ourselves and could prove useful for you, too.
- All code to create synthesis datasets, you find in the respective folders for [grassland diversity](https://github.com/biodiversity-exploratories-synthesis/Synthesis_dataset_diversity_grassland), [grassland functions](https://github.com/biodiversity-exploratories-synthesis/Synthesis_dataset_functions_grassland), [forest diversity](https://github.com/biodiversity-exploratories-synthesis/Synthesis_dataset_diversity_forest)
