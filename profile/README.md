# Welcome to the Biodiversity Exploratories Core Synthesis Page!
<img align="right" width="100" height="100" src="../../biodiversity-exploratories-synthesis.github.io/assets/explos_logo.svg">This space is maintained by the [Core Project Biodiversity Synthesis](https://www.biodiversity-exploratories.de/en/projects/core-project-10-biodiversity-synthesis/) of the [Biodiversity Exploratories](https://www.biodiversity-exploratories.de/en/). Here we share news, manuals, code and teaching material. In oder to help you navigate around our page, here is a little overview about the content we provide. Follow the links below or just browse our Repositories and their Readme files. 

If you are new to GitHub : Welcome! Repositories are like folders, each of them contains a file called "Readme" in which the content of the current folder is described.

# News
In 2022, we will organise two :boom: exciting courses/workshops :boom: we are looking forward to:
- In April/ May : **Functional and phylogenetic measures with [Carlos Carmona](https://teguam.es/miembros/carlos-pcarmona/)**
- Later in 2022 : **Meta-Analysis with Prof. [Julia Koricheva](https://pure.royalholloway.ac.uk/portal/en/persons/julia-koricheva(ab83b389-7258-48fd-8560-0c8de7b6c94a).html)**


# Overview of content
### Manuals
- The [**Synthesis dataset manual**](https://github.com/biodiversity-exploratories-synthesis/Synthesis_dataset_manual/blob/main/Synthesis%20datasets%20%20How%20to%20use.md) helps you to work with the Synthesis datasets. It  provides information and tips on how to handle the datasets and outlines the common issues when analysing these datasets.

### Code
- All code to create synthesis datasets is in their respective folders: [grassland diversity](https://github.com/biodiversity-exploratories-synthesis/Synthesis_dataset_diversity_grassland), [grassland functions](https://github.com/biodiversity-exploratories-synthesis/Synthesis_dataset_functions_grassland), [forest diversity](https://github.com/biodiversity-exploratories-synthesis/Synthesis_dataset_diversity_forest)
- In [**useful functions**](https://github.com/biodiversity-exploratories-synthesis/Synthesis_useful_functions) you can find a collection of functions that we often use ourselves and that could be useful when working with Biodiversity Exploratories datasets. 

### Teaching material
Teaching material is in the [**courses workshops**](https://github.com/biodiversity-exploratories-synthesis/Synthesis_courses_workshops) folder.

### Links
- current [list of synthesis proposals](https://www.bexis.uni-jena.de/FMT/GeneralFiles/Show?viewTitle=General%20Documents&viewName=GeneralFiles&rootMenu=BeoInformation) (you need to be logged in to BExIS). Please remember, that a Proposal including **Data from 3 or more projects** is a synthesis project, and needs a respective proposal. Further information about synthesis proposal writing can be found in the current [Rules of Procedure](https://www.bexis.uni-jena.de/FMT/GeneralFiles/DownloadFile?path=FMT\\BeoInformation\\GeneralInformation\\BE-Gesch√§ftsordnung (Rules of procedure)_2021-02-19.pdf&mimeType=.pdf) (requires you to be logged in to BExIS). 

# How to contribute
We welcome any contribution! If you want to contribute code (e.g. useful functions), want to report an error or make a suggestion, please do not hesitate to contact us by email, make a pull request via Github or open a Github issue in the repository of interest.
